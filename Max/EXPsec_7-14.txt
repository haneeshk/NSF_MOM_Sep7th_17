Since the spicules' silica layers are both thin and brittle, measuring the fracture toughness, $g_{cI}$, of the weak interfaces between them is a challenging task. Motivated by the classical fiber push-out test~\cite{marshall1984indentation}, which is used to measure interface toughness in fiber reinforced composites, we have designed the following ``cylinder push-out'' test for measuring $g_{cI}$.

One broken spicule segment from each bending test (see Task 3.) will be embedded in epoxy and cross-sectioned using a slow speed diamond saw to create a 1--3 mm thick slab (see Figure~\ref{fig:spicule} (d)).
%
The exposed spicule cross-section will first be polished, and then a blunt diamond indenter will be used to push against the core.
%
On the opposite side of the slab, all silica cylinders will be mechanically supported (see Figure~\ref{fig:spicule} (d)).
%
This configuration will freeze the relative motion of all weak interfaces except the first one between the core and the adjacent silica cylinder.
%
Thus, the core and the silica cylinders are analogous to the fiber and matrix, respectively, in the fiber push-out test~\cite{marshall1984indentation}.

We will adapt the MTS, which we used to perform the bending tests, to perform the cylinder push-out test. During the test we will measure the applied force and indenter displacement. 
%
We have made preliminary estimates of the force and displacement ranges needed for this test and found that our modified MTS will be able to perform the cylinder push-out test with 50 nm displacement resolution and 4 $\mu$N force resolution.

A typical load-displacement curve from a fiber push-out performed on a silicon carbide fiber reinforced composite is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:spicule} (e). 
%
Initially, the applied force increases linearly with indenter displacement. 
%
The abrupt drop in force from $P_d$ to $P_d^'$ corresponds to the formation of a crack along the fiber-matrix interface as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:spicule} (d).  
%
Upon further loading, the  applied force again increases until it reaches $P_i$, at which point the crack begins to propagate along the length of the fiber. 
%
If the length of the crack, $l_d$, at $P_d^'$ is large compared to the fiber's radius, $r_0$, then the initiation force, $P_i$, is related to $g_{cI}$ as $P_i=2\pi \sqrt{r_0^3 g_{cI} E^*}$~\cite{outwater1970fracture, kerans1991theoretical, liang1993mechanics}. 
%
Knowing $E^*$ (from Task.1.i), and $r_0$, we will compute $g_{cI}$ by measuring $P_i$ in the cylinder push-out test. However, after the test is completed we must verify that $l_d>>r_0$. 
%
We can compute $l_d$ by measuring the stiffness from the force-displacement response before and after crack nucleation, and choosing $l_d$ in a finite element model to match this stiffness ratio. 
%
If $l_d$ is not much larger than $r_0$, then we will numerically compute the energy release rate for the cylinder push out test using a finite element model~\cite{moran1987crack}
