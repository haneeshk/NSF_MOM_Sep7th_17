An id-SB's architecture dictates how it fails and what kind of toughening mechanisms are operating during failure. The toughnesses predicted by theoretical mechanics models consisting of simplified versions of id-SB architectures often fall short of what is observed experimentally (REF barthelat vincent, currey, Kamat/ballarini 2000). The PI believes that this discrepancy arises because the theoretical models are too simple and leave out important architectural features that may precipitate new and important toughening mechanisms. 

There have, however, been efforts to build computational models that fully capture the architectural complexity of id-SBs. While these computational models overcome the problem of oversimplification, the spectrum of toughening mechanisms that they can capture is often limited. This limitation arises due to the assumptions underlying the computational methods. For example, many computational methods, such as XXX, require that the trajectory of crack growth be specified as an input. Models based on these methods are therefore unable to capture toughening due to crack deflection and branching.

Compared to existing computational methods, the assumptions underlying PFT are very basic and therefore it is able to capture a greater diversity of mechanisms. Specifically, the PFT-based computational tool does not rely on a priori information about crack path evolution. The PI believes that this tool can be used as part of a virtual laboratory that can predict the behavior of id-SBs. In order to be useful though, the PFT tool must correctly predict both an id-SB's mechanical response and its toughening mechanisms.

The PI proposes a case study of a relatively simple id-SB to demonstrate the predictive power of the PFT based computational tool. The PI will study toughening mechanisms in the skeletal elements, known as spicules, of the marine sponge \textit{Euplectella aspergillum}. The spicules are an ideal model id-SB to investigate because of their architectural simplicity, and the brittle nature of their constituent materials. Furthermore, the PI has extensive experience imaging, and mechanically testing the spicules (REF monn, and monn 2016 in prep). The spicules are hair-like fibers that are roughly 10 cm long and 50 $\mu$m in diameter (see Figure XXX). A spicule's cross-section reveals its internal architecture, which consists of roughly 25 concentric cylinders separated from one another by protein-filled interfaces (see Figure XXX). Each cylinder is 200--1200 $\mu$m thick and is composed of silica (REF monn). At the spicule's center is a monolithic core approximately 20 $\mu$m in diameter.

The PI has chosen to study the spicules over other id-SBs like shell and bone because of their relative architectural simplicity. For example, hundreds of parameters are needed to describe all of the salient architectural features in bone, while the spicules can be described using roughly 30 parameters (i.e., layer thicknesses, elastic and failure properties of both the silica and interfaces).

The proposed investigation of the spicules consists of two major components: 1) constructing a model of the spicule using the PFT computational tool to predict its failure behavior, and 2) measuring the failure behavior of the spicules and comparing the measurements to the model's predictions. In order to construct a model of the spicule, the PI will first measure the spicule's architecture as well as the elastic and toughness properties of its constituents. 
%The PI has already measured the layer thicknesses of spicules (REF monn) and will use a similar procedure in the proposed research. Briefly, this involves embedding the spicules in epoxy, fracturing them and imaging them using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). 
The toughness properties of the silica layers have previously been measured using nano-indentation experiments (REF woesz). The PI has designed a custom mechanical testing stage for performing three point bending tests on the spicules in order to measure the elastic properties of the silica (see Section XXX). Finally, the PI proposes a new experiment (see Section XXX) to measure the elastic and toughness properties of the interfaces. Using these measured elastic, toughness, and architectural parameters the PI will create a 3D model of a spicule using the PFT computational tool (described in Section XXX).

The second component of the proposed investigation involves measuring the mechanical response of a spicule as it fails. The PI has already performed three point bending tests on spicules and will use the same configuration for conducting the proposed fracture tests. However, to compare the mechanical response of the spicules to that predicted by the computational model, an initial crack or small notch must created from which fracture will initiate. Due to the spiculesâ€™ size (roughly that of a human hair), notches cannot be cut using conventional tools, such as diamond saws, or razor blades. The PI proposes to use focused ion beam (FIB) milling to cut the notches in the spicules. This method has been used in previous studies on silicon to notch micrometer-scale flexural and tensile specimens (REF). The PI has performed a pilot notching study (see Figure XXX) and found that notches of the desired dimensions and sharpness can be cut in the spicules using the FIB milling procedure. The PI will measure the mechanical response of the notched spicules in the three point bending configuration until failure. Subsequently, he will compare these measurements to the predictions obtained from the computational model of the spicule (see Section XXX). 

A preliminary comparison of the force-displacement response of un-notched spicules and that predicted using a 2D spicule model (see Section XXX) are shown in Figure XXX. While the model in this preliminary comparison is an extreme simplification of the spicule, many of the same features manifest in the force-displacement responses. This provides motivation for the PI to investigate the predictive power of the PFT computational tool using a more realistic spicule model. To compare the toughening mechanisms in the experiment and computational model, we will image the spicules after they are fractured using a SEM and compare the fracture surface to the crack path predicted by the computational model. The PI does not expect the crack paths to match exactly, due to the stochastic nature of fracture. However, the PI expects that the overall features of the crack path will be similar. He will compare the two crack paths using metrics such as mean roughness, and total crack length in order to evaluate the predictive power of the PFT tool.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Preliminary Bending Tests %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The custom-built testing stage was used to perform a type of 3 point bending test on the spicules. Details of the configuration can be found in~\cite[Ch. 3.1]{frisch1962flexible}. Briefly, a spicule was suspended across a trench cut in a stainless steel plate and was loaded by a wedge-like loading point mid way across the trench's span (see Figure XXX). The loading point is supported by a cantilever, whose deflection is measured by an optical sensor and converted into force. This cantilever-based design is similar to an AFM and has been used in a number of micro- and macro-scale mechanical testing studies~\cite{waters2009mode, waters2009contact}. The magnitude of the transverse force, $F$, and the transverse deflection of a spicule's axis at the loading point, $w_0$, were recorded until the spicule failed (see Figure XXX). The $w_0$--$F$ data for 30 spicules are shown in Figure XXX. 

We computed the Young's modulus, $E$, of each spicule using the $w_0$--$F$ relationship for a simply supported Euler-Bernoulli beam (REF Timoshenko and Gere, Beer and Johnson), $E=k L^3/48I$ where $k$ is the slope of the linear portion of the $w_0$--$F$ response, $L$ is the trench's span, and $I=\pi D^4/64$ is the second moment of inertia for a round beam of diameter $D$. The diameter of the spicule was measured from SEM images, and the trench span was measured using an optical microscope. The stiffness $k$ was obtained by fitting a line to the linear portion of the $w_0$--$F$ data. The mean Young's modulus from the 30 spicules we tested is XXX GPa, which is consistent with values reported by (REFS). We will used these measurements to construct the model of a spicule using the PFT computational tool.

We also mechanically tested spicules from a related species, \textit{Tethya aurantia}, that are monolithic and possess no internal architecture (see Figure XXX). To differentiate between the two types of spicules, we refer to the \textit{E. aspergillum} spicules and \textit{T. aurantia} spicules as EASs and TASs, respectively. While the TASs lack the concentrically layered architecture of the EASs, they are composed of a very similar silica material (REF Weaver JOA). Therefore, by comparing the $w_0$--$F$ responses of the EASs and the TASs (shown in Figure XXX), we can determine the effect of an EAS's architecture on its mechanical response.

As can be seen in Figure XXX, the $w_0$--$F$ response of a TAS is linear until the spicule fails abruptly and catastrophically. On the other hand, the $w_0$--$F$ response of an EAS is first linear like the response of the TASs but then becomes jagged as the displacement becomes large. In previous studies, this jaggedness has been attributed to the sequential fracture of individual silica cylinders (REF). We compare the difference in $w_0$--$F$ responses between TASs and EASs to analogous computational models (described in Section XXX). The computational model of a monolithic beam predicts a $w_0$--$F$ response similar to that of the TASs. Interestingly, we find that the $w_0$--$F$ response predicted by the multi layered beam model with weak interfaces between adjacent layers is qualitatively similar to the jagged response of the EASs. Furthermore, we can see that the sawtooth jumps in the $w_0$--$F$ response of the computational model correspond to crack branching and interfacial crack propagation. Similarly, in SEM images of the fractured ends of the EASs there is evidence of crack deflection at the interfaces between silica cylinders (see Figure XXX).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Shear Experiment %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The PI proposes a novel method for measuring the shear stiffness and fracture toughness of the interfaces between the spicules' silica cylinders.
Briefly, a spicule will be embedded in  epoxy and cross-sectioned using a slow speed diamond saw. The thin disk consisting of a cross-sectioned segment of the spicule and the surrounding epoxy will first be imaged using a SEM to measure the number of silica cylinders and cylinder thicknesses. Next the disk will be gripped by the epoxy region and mounted to a modified version of the testing stage described in Section XXX. A cylindrical punch will be used to apply force on the spicule's core, normal to its cross-section (see Figure XXX). This will cause the cylinders to shear in a telescoping manner along the spicule's axis. We will measure the applied force and the displacement of the indenter until one of the interfaces between the silica cylinders fails. 

To compute the stiffness of the interfaces, the PI will use a continuum mechanics model of the spicule (see Figure XXX) constructed using the measured cylinder thicknesses. The PI will use this continuum mechanics model to relate the applied force, $P$, and displacement of the spicule core, $d$, to the shear modulus of the interfaces. We assume that the interfaces all have the same thickness, $t$, and shear modulus, $G$. By assuming that the spicule segment is axisymmetric and that the silica layers are much stiffer than the interfaces we model the spicule segment as a concentric arrangement of rigid cylinders separated by thin linear elastic cylinders. Since the thin elastic cylinders representing the interfaces are confined between the rigid cylinders representing the silica layers, we assume that the radial component of displacement within the elastic cylinders is zero. Using this model, the shear modulus of the  interface material is $G=P/(2 \pi L d) \sum_{i=1}^N[\log(r_i)-\log(r_i+t)$, where $L$ is the segment's length, $N$ is the number of silica cylinders, and $r_i$ is the inner radius of the i$^th$ interface.

The fracture toughness of the interfaces will be computed by integrating the force-displacement curve until failure and dividing this total work done on the spicule segment by the surface area of the interface that failed. The surface area will be computed by measuring the radius of the cylinder at which the interface failed from an SEM image obtained after the test is performed.

The primary challenge of this proposed experiment will be designing a fixture so that the cylindrical punch can be centered over a spicule's core on the mechanical testing stage. The PI's lab has extensive experience designing fixtures for the mechanical testing stage that will be used for this test. Since the core is only roughly 20 $\mu$m in diameter the positioning of the cylindrical punch must be very precise. For this reason, the PI plans to fabricate a two piece fixture consisting of a sample holder and a punch aligner. The epoxy disk containing the spicule will be affixed to the sample holder. The cylinder punch will be mounted on the punch aligner which can be articulated relative to the sample holder using a 2-axis motorized stage. The punch will be manually aligned so that it is centered over the spicule's core under a high magnification optical microscope using the motorized stage. Once aligned, the assembly of the sample holder and punch will be mounted on the mechanical testing stage. Funds are requested for the design and fabrication of the fixture needed to align the punch and spicule core.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% ALTERNATE SHEAR Experiment %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The PI proposes to measure the fracture toughness of the interfaces between the spicules' silica cylinders using a fiber push-out test. This test was originally developed to measure the properties of interfaces in fiber reinforced composites (REF Marshall). In this test, a specimen is cut and polished so that the embedded fibers are oriented normal to the free surface. A flat-tipped indenter is used to push against the exposed end of a single fiber, normal to the fiber's axis (see Figure XXX). The applied force, $F$, and indenter deflection, $\delta$, are measured as the fiber deforms, debonds form the suroounding matrix, and eventually slides frictionally along the interface. Several theoretical mechanics models based on a fracture mechanics approach have been proposed to determine the interface properties (e.g., coefficient of friction, interface toughness) using the $F$-$\delta$ response (REF Zhou, Hutchinson, Keran_a). It has been shown that these models can accurately describe the $F$-$\delta$ response of the fiber throughout the failure process (REF Bright, Keran_b). The PI will use the approach described in (REF Kerans_a and Kerans_b) to compute the fracture toughness of the interfaces between the spicules' silica cylinders.

The PI plans to treat the spicule's core as a fiber that is surrounded by the first silica cylinder, which he takes to be analogous to the matrix in the push-out test. Therefore, in this case the matrix and fiber have the same Young's modulus, $E$ and Poisson's ratio, $\nu$. The PI proposes to design a testing fixture that will support the first silica cylinder on one side and apply force to the core on the other (see Figure XXX). A preliminary design of this fixture is described below. Funds for the design and fabrication of this fixture are requested as part of the budget.

Briefly, a spicule will be embedded in epoxy and sectioned using a slow speed diamond saw so that its axis is normal to the cut surface (see Figure XXX). The disk, approximately 3 mm thick, consisting of the cross-sectioned spicule segment and the surrounding epoxy will first be polished using standard metallographic polishing procedures, and then be clamped to the frame of the testing fixture (see Figure XXX). Two support blocks will be adjusted using motorized linear piezo stages so that they overlap with the spicule's first silica cylinder. This alignment will be performed manually within a scanning electron microscope (SEM). On the other side of the specimen, a cylindrical indenter made of silicon that is roughly 15 $\mu$m in diameter will be centered over the spicule's core using a similar procedure (see Figure XXX). The the specimen, support blocks, and indenter assembly will be mounted on a load cell and  the cylinder will be pressed into the spicule's core using a linear actuator. The displacement of the indenter and applied load will be recorded until failure is indicated by the first significant load drop (REF Kerans_a).

In the model proposed in (REF Kerans_a), before catastrophic failure occurs the $F$-$\delta$ response is given by
%
\begin{equation}
\label{KeransFd}
\delta=C_m F-\frac{1-\nu^2}{\nu \mu \pi r E}\left[F-P_d+P^* \log\left(\frac{P^*-F}{P^*-P_d}\right)\right],
\end{equation}
%
where $C_m$ is the machine compliance, $\mu$ is the coefficient of friction between the core and the first silica cylinder, $r$ is the radius of the core, and $P^*$ is a parameter related to the clamping force of the matrix on the fiber. This clamping force includes contributions from the expansion of the epoxy during curing, pre-stress in the silica cylinders, and Poisson expansion of the core due to the compressive stress generated by the test. The parameter $P_d$ is related to the interface fracture toughness, $G_i$, by
%
\begin{equation}
\label{PdG}
P_d=-\sqrt{\frac{4 \pi^2 r^3 E G_i}{1-\nu^2}}.
\end{equation}
%

The PI will measure $C_m$ in a calibration test. The core's radius will be measured from SEM images taken during the fixture alignment procedure. The Young's modulus of the silica will be computed using the load-displacement response measured in three point bending tests described in Section XXX, and the Poisson's ratio is taken to be that of synthetic silica, $\nu=0.2$ (REF). Three parameters, namely $\mu$, $P_d$, and $P^*$ are still undetermined in Eqn.~\eqref{KeransFd}.  To determine these parameters, Eqn.~\eqref{KeransFd} will be fit to the measured $F$-$\delta$ response using nonlinear least squares. Subsequently, the interface fracture toughness, $G_i$, can be computed from Eqn.~\eqref{PdG}.

To design the testing fixture, it is important to choose a correctly sized load cell. The load cell must be able to measure forces large enough to cause the debonding failure, and must be sensitive enough to resolve the initial load drop after debonding. To estimate the peak force during the test we take the shear traction acting at the interface to be uniform. In this case the peak force $F_\mathrm{peak}=2 \pi r L \tau_f$, where $L$ is the length of the spicule segment and $\tau_f$ is the theoretical shear strength of the interface. We take the theoretical shear strength $\tau_f$ to be on the order of $E_i/30$, where $E_i$ is the Young's modulus of the collagen-like protein that fills the space between the silica layers. Previous measurements of the elastic properties of collagen fibrils (REF Yang 2008) indicate that $E_i\approx$75 Mpa. We take $L$ to be 3 mm and $r$ to be 10 $\mu$m (REF Monn2015). From this, we estimate $F_\mathrm{peak}$ to be 0.47 N.
