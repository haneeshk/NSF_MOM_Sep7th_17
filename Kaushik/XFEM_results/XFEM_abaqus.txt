Damage initiation - If a critical value of max stress or strain is reached then damage ($d$) initiates. 
The damage variable $d = 0$ indicates the material is intact and $d=1$ means complete failure.
Damage evolution - After damage initiation, this dictates how damage evolves. For instance, in the linear case
d goes to from 0 to 1 as the displacement in the failed element reaches $u_f$.

\begin{align}
\dot{d} = \frac{\dot{u}}{u_f}.
\end{align}

Fracture Criterion: This sets the direction in which crack propagates. Maximum tangential stress criterion is the default criterion when using LEFM based XFEM method.
